   -  1) INTRODUCTION    
  --------------------
    I hope you enjoy using Code Library.
    It was a fun program to make.  If you have
    any comments or questions about it, contact me.

    Note:
    Extract the Activebar.zip files into your C:\WINDOWS\ folder.

   -  2) DESCRIPTION     
  --------------------
    Code Library will save and/or recall frequently
    used pieces of text/code.  Files can be opened
    simply by clicking on them in the file listbox.
    A list of your last 10 recently opened files is
    available from the File menu.

  
    Many options are available for you such as:

    - Change background/foreground color of textboxes
    - Controls and toolbar can be hidden for easier text viewing
    - Rename, delete and create folders and files
    - Three frequently used folders can be mapped to buttons
    - Have multiple files open at once
    - Preferences are saved and then loaded at program startup
    - Print selected text or the whole document
    - A Find/Find Next/Replace utility is available
    - Use it like a clipboard so you can save multiple entries
    - Specify file filters
    - Specify font type
